# Casual Projects

## Overview
This repository is about having fun and trying out different projects I see online. Some things that might be included in it are:
* Practice scripts for data science
* Fun and cool projects that I see online that I want to replicate
* Scripts following along tutorials
* Scripts following specific python package tutorials

## Some Things I'm interested in delving into:
Topics for this may vary greatly but are just the tip of the iceberg. After all it's just for fun.
* Raspberry PI applications and online modules
* How to make your own framework/module and publish it
* How to contribute to an online open-source project
* Interactive data visualizations
* Shell scripts for automating tasks and running schedules
* "10 Python Projects and Applications to get you Jump Started"

## Types of Files Expected in here
There are some file types that I could expect to be working with in here. Some of these are just to practice using the tools, for the sake of practice on how to implement them.
* Dockerfiles
* Kubernetes
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Bash Scripts
* Python Scripts
* HTML
* Maybe some java script if I feel adventurous enough
* JSON
* SQL data and queries
